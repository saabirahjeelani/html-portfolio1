<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>i loved this movie a lot. The best line from this movie was 
    <p><i>Cooper : We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. ...<br>
    Cooper : Mankind was born on Earth. ...<br>

<h3> The Devil Wears Prada </h3>
<p>i loved the concept and every thing. The best line from this movie was 
    <p><i>"You sold your soul to the devil when you put on your first pair of Jimmy Choos. I saw it."</i></p>

<h3>Before Sunrise</h3>
<p>it was a very beautiful movie. The best quote of this movie was 
    <p><i>“I believe if there's any kind of God it wouldn't be in any of us,<br>
        not you or me but just this little space in between. <br>
        If there's any kind of magic in this world it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something. <br>
        I know, it's almost impossible to succeed but who cares really? The answer must be in the attempt.”</i></p>
